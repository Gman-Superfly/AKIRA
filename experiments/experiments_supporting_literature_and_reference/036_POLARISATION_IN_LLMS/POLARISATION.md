Are LLMs polarized? Do they skew toward a positive (MUST ANSWER) charge? They are trained to answer but they might not have the correct quasiparticle excitations to do so, so the correct balance cannot be achieved. Similar to massive fields in physics, is spontaneous ejection of particles (virtual particles) from this imbalance the reason they are prone to hallucinations? If they were balanced would they hallucinate less? This also includes the context window, if the context is positive or negative. How does this interact with the LLM charge itself? What does it take for the dark attractor to take over?
