    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Test whether complex ACTION DISCRIMINATIONS decompose into simpler AQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "From `ACTION_QUANTA.md`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "AQ (pattern) -> enables DISCRIMINATION -> enables ACTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Single AQ: Simple pattern -> Simple discrimination -> Simple action\n",
    "Bonded state: Multiple AQ -> Complex discrimination -> Complex action\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From `RADAR_ARRAY.md`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "BONDED STATE: \"Anti-ship missile inbound\"\n",
    "  = AQ1 (CLOSING RAPIDLY) + AQ2 (CLOSE!) + AQ3 (SEA-SKIMMING) + ...\n",
    "  -> Enables ACTION: \"ENGAGE IMMEDIATELY\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "If AQ theory is correct:\n",
    "1. Complex action discriminations should show activation patterns containing their component AQ\n",
    "2. Adding more AQ components should produce predictably combined patterns\n",
    "3. The bonded state activation should be related to (but not simply sum of) component activations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insight: AQ are about ACTION, not MEANING\n",
    "\n",
    "We test prompts that require the model to discriminate between ACTION alternatives:\n",
    "- FLEE vs STAY\n",
    "- URGENT vs NOT URGENT  \n",
    "- ENGAGE vs WAIT\n",
    "- ACT NOW vs DELAY\n",
