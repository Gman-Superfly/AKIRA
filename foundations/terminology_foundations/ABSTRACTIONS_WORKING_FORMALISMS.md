# Abstractions Working Formalisms

## Document Purpose

This is a **working document** to formalize the relationship between AKIRA's terminology (crystallized AQ, bonded states) and the scientific concept of "abstraction" as used in reinforcement learning (Sutton), neurosymbolic AI, and cybernetics.

**Status:** Under discussion - not finalized terminology

This is what connects AKIRA to Sutton's abstraction framework:

> **Sutton**: State abstraction groups states. Temporal abstraction groups actions.
> **Both are fundamentally related to ACTION.**

AKIRA's AQ are exactly this:
- **AQ are defined by ACTIONABILITY** (minimum pattern needed for correct action)
- **Bonded states enable HIGHER-LEVEL ACTION** (composed abstractions that guide complex behavior)

| Perspective | Describes | Key Question |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Structure** (bonded state) | HOW things combine | How do AQ join? (phase alignment, coherence) |
| **Function** (abstraction) | WHAT the combination does | What does it enable? (action, generalization) |

---

## The Core Question

> Is AKIRA's "bonded state" (formerly "molecule") actually what the scientific literature calls an "abstraction"?

**Answer: YES.** The induction logic below demonstrates this.

---

## The Induction Logic: From Superposition to Abstraction

### Step 1: The Starting Point - Superposition of Belief

The system begins with a **superposition of belief states**:
- Multiple possible interpretations exist simultaneously
- High synergy (information distributed across possibilities)
- Wave-like, reducible, uncertain

This is the pre-action state: many possibilities, no commitment.

### Step 2: Collapse Extracts What Matters for Action

**Collapse** is the phase transition from superposition to crystallized state:

```
SUPERPOSITION                    COLLAPSE                      CRYSTALLIZED
(many possibilities)     →    (phase transition)     →    (irreducible unit)
High synergy                    Energy minimization           High redundancy
Distributed                     Selection                     Concentrated
Wave-like                       Extraction                    Particle-like
```

**What survives collapse?** Only what is needed for correct action.

- Irrelevant features are discarded
- Essential features are preserved
- The minimum pattern for action emerges

### Step 3: The Result is an Action Quantum (AQ)

A **Crystallized AQ** is:
- ACTION QUANTUM IS STRUCTURAL DEFINITION
- The MINIMUM pattern needed for correct action
- IRREDUCIBLE (cannot be simplified further without losing actionability)
- STABLE (persists as long as it remains useful)
- GROUNDED (emerged from signal, not imposed)

**This IS the definition of an atomic abstraction:**
- ATOMIC ABSTRACTION IS FUNCTIONAL DEFINITION
- Captures essential features
- Discards irrelevant details
- Enables generalization
- Task-relative (what matters depends on the action required)

```
CRITICAL DISTINCTION: STRUCTURE vs FUNCTION
───────────────────────────────────────────

AQ (pattern) → enables DISCRIMINATION → enables ACTION

STRUCTURAL: AQ = Minimum PATTERN (what it IS)
FUNCTIONAL: Discrimination = ATOMIC ABSTRACTION (what it DOES)

IMPORTANT:
  - AQ is NOT the abstraction
  - AQ ENABLES the abstraction
  - Discrimination IS the functional abstraction at atomic level

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LEVEL      STRUCTURAL           FUNCTIONAL        RESULT  │
│  ─────      ──────────           ──────────        ──────  │
│  Atomic     AQ (pattern)    →    Discrimination →  Action  │
│                                  (atomic abstr.)           │
│                                                            │
│  Composed   Bonded state    →    Classification →  Complex │
│             (pattern combo)      (composed abstr.) action  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 4: AQ Combine into Bonded States

Individual AQ combine through **phase alignment** to form **bonded states**:

```
AQ₁ + AQ₂ + AQ₃  →  Bonded State
(primitives)        (composed structure)
```

The bonding mechanism:
- Phase coherence determines valid combinations
- Cross-band bonds create hierarchy
- Stable configurations persist

### Step 5: Bonded States ARE Composed Abstractions

A **Bonded State** is:
- A combination of irreducible primitives (AQ)
- Stable (the combination holds together)
- Enables higher-level action (complex behavior from simple units)
- Compositional (can combine further into nested structures)

**This IS the definition of a composed abstraction:**
- Built from atomic abstractions
- Creates higher-level meaning
- Enables complex action from primitive units

   SINGULAR ACTION QUANTUM, PLURAL ACTION QUANTA

### The Complete Induction Chain

```
Superposition of Belief
        ↓
    [COLLAPSE]
        ↓
Crystallized AQ (pattern) → enables DISCRIMINATION (atomic abstraction)
        ↓
    [BONDING via phase alignment]
        ↓
Bonded State (pattern combo) → enables CLASSIFICATION (composed abstraction)
        ↓
    [NESTING]
        ↓
Nested Bonded States → enable COMPLEX DECISION PROGRAMS (hierarchical abstraction)

NOTE: AQ is NOT the abstraction. AQ ENABLES the abstraction.
      Discrimination IS the functional abstraction at atomic level.
```

## Background: Where This Question Came From

### The Terminology Evolution

1. Originally used "molecule" (chemistry analogy: atoms combine into molecules)
2. Changed to "crystallized" for post-collapse STATE (emphasizing irreducibility)
3. Introduced "bonded state" for combined crystallized AQ (tentative term)
4. Now questioning: Is "bonded state" actually "abstraction"?

### The Chemistry Analogy

The chemistry analogy served us well:
- AQ as atoms (irreducible units)
- Combinations as molecules (bonded configurations)
- Hierarchy as molecular structures

But "molecule" is a STRUCTURAL metaphor. It describes HOW things combine, not WHAT the combination represents or DOES.

---

## AKIRA's Bonded States ARE Abstractions

AKIRA's bonded states are abstractions in the **precise scientific sense**.

### What the "Bonded" Metaphor Captures

The chemistry/bonding terminology captures **STRUCTURE**:

| Structural Concept | What It Describes |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Composition** | Crystallized AQs combine → Composed abstraction |
| **Bonds** | How things (actions) combine to form composed abstractions |
| **Stability** | Stable sets that can be used for creating complex actions |
| **Phase alignment** | The mechanism that determines valid combinations |

### What "Abstraction" Adds

The abstraction terminology captures **FUNCTION**:

| Functional Concept | What It Adds |
|--------------------|--------------|
| **Established scientific term** | Connects to decades of research |
| **Implies compression/generalization** | What abstractions DO |
| **Connects to Sutton, neurosymbolic, cognitive science** | Bridges literatures |
| **Clearer functional meaning** | Why these structures exist |

## Sutton's Abstraction Framework

### Key Insight from Sutton

> In RL, **state abstraction** groups states, **temporal abstraction** groups actions.
> These are **fundamentally related to action**.

This is precisely what AQ and bonded states do:
- AQ are defined by ACTIONABILITY (minimum needed for correct action)
- Bonded states enable HIGHER-LEVEL ACTION (concepts that guide behavior)

### Types of Abstraction in RL (Sutton)

| Type | What it does | AKIRA Parallel |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| State abstraction | Groups equivalent states | Crystallized AQ (irreducible state feature) |
| Temporal abstraction | Groups action sequences (options) | Bonded states spanning time? |
| Action abstraction | Groups equivalent actions | AQ that enable same decision |

### Sutton's "Grounded Abstractions"

Recent work emphasizes that abstractions must be:
- **Grounded** in sensorimotor experience
- **Useful** for prediction and control
- **Emergent** from learning, not imposed

This matches AKIRA exactly:
- AQ emerge from training (grounded)
- AQ are defined by actionability (useful)
- Collapse extracts them (emergent)

---

## Neurosymbolic Literature on Abstraction

### The Binding Problem

How do features combine into objects? This is exactly what bonded states solve:
- Individual AQ = features
- Bonded state = bound object representation
- Phase coherence = binding mechanism

### Compositional Generalization

Abstractions enable novel combinations:
- Known primitives combine in new ways
- System generalizes to unseen configurations
- This is what bonded states should enable

### Symbol Grounding

How do symbols acquire meaning? In AKIRA:
- AQ are grounded in the signal (spectral decomposition)
- Meaning comes from actionability (task defines relevance)
- Not arbitrary symbols but emergent patterns

---

## Cybernetic Literature

### Ashby's Requisite Variety

A controller must have as much variety as the system it controls.
- Abstractions REDUCE variety to match cognitive capacity
- AQ are the MINIMUM variety needed for action
- Bonded states organize variety hierarchically

### Beer's Viable System Model

Hierarchical abstractions for management:
- Level N abstracts over Level N-1
- Each level handles different timescales
- Maps to AKIRA's band hierarchy?

### Bateson's "Difference That Makes a Difference"

Information = abstraction of what matters
- AQ capture differences that make a difference for the task
- Irrelevant differences are discarded in collapse
- This IS the definition of abstraction

---

## Does AKIRA's "Bonded State" Meet the Definition of Abstraction?

### Criterion 1: Captures essential features, discards irrelevant details

**YES:**
- AQ are irreducible (minimum needed for action)
- The collapse process removes non-essential information
- What survives is what's actionable
- Compression during training forces this

### Criterion 2: Formed by extracting commonalities

**YES:**
- Through training, patterns that recur become AQ
- Compression forces generalization
- The same AQ applies across instances
- Similar to how symbols abstract over instances

### Criterion 3: Enables generalization

**YES:**
- AQ are task-defined, not instance-specific
- Bonded states can be applied to new situations
- Novel combinations of known AQ = compositional generalization
- This is the core purpose of abstraction

### Criterion 4: Compositional

**YES:**
- AQ combine into bonded states
- Bonded states can nest into higher structures
- Phase alignment determines valid combinations
- Hierarchy emerges naturally

### Criterion 5: Hierarchical

**YES:**
- Low-freq AQ (coarse) contextualize high-freq AQ (fine)
- Cross-band bonds create hierarchy
- Nested bonded states form abstraction towers
- This matches abstraction hierarchies in other frameworks

### Dual Terminology: Structure and Function

```
STRUCTURE TERM          FUNCTION TERM               MEANING
──────────────          ─────────────               ───────
Crystallized AQ         Atomic abstraction          Minimum unit of action
Bonded state            Composed abstraction        Combined action units
Nested bonded state     Hierarchical abstraction    Multi-level action structure

(Use STRUCTURE terms when discussing HOW: spectral, phase, collapse)
(Use FUNCTION terms when discussing WHAT/WHY: action, generalization)
```

### What This Mapping Provides

1. **Connection to literature**: AKIRA speaks the same language as Sutton, neurosymbolic AI, cybernetics
2. **Clarity of function**: "Abstraction" emphasizes WHAT it does (compress, generalize, enable action)
3. **Maintained specificity**: AKIRA's implementation (spectral, phase-based, collapse-emergent) is still unique
4. **Actionability as the core**: Both AQ and abstractions are defined by their relationship to ACTION

### What We Keep from AKIRA Terminology

| Term | What It Describes | Why We Keep It |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Crystallized** | The STATE after collapse | Emphasizes irreducibility and phase transition |
| **Quasiparticle** | The NATURE of AQ | Captures emergent excitation behavior |
| **Collapse/Tension** | The PROCESSES that form abstractions | Describes the phase transition mechanism |
| **Spectral** | The REPRESENTATION | AKIRA's unique implementation |
| **Bonded state** | The STRUCTURE of composition | How AQ combine mechanically |

### The Two Perspectives Unified

| Aspect | Chemistry Metaphor | Abstraction Framework |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Describes | STRUCTURE | FUNCTION |
| Key question | HOW do things combine? | WHY do they combine? |
| Answer | Phase alignment, coherence | To enable higher-level action |
| Insight | Mechanism of composition | Purpose of composition |

Both perspectives are valid and complementary:
- **Structure (bonded state)**: How AQ combine (phase alignment, cross-band bonds)
- **Function (abstraction)**: What the combination DOES (enables higher-level action)

**The unified view**: Bonded states are the STRUCTURAL implementation of FUNCTIONAL abstractions.

---

## Questions to Resolve

### 1. Should we rename "bonded state" to "abstraction"?

**Arguments FOR:**
- Aligns with scientific literature
- Emphasizes function over structure
- Connects to Sutton, neurosymbolic, cybernetics
- More accessible to readers from those fields

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- "Abstraction" is overloaded/vague
- Loses the structural insight of bonding
- Chemistry analogy is intuitive
- May cause confusion with other uses of "abstraction"

### 2. Can we use both terms?

Perhaps:
- "Abstraction" when discussing FUNCTION
- "Bonded state" when discussing STRUCTURE/MECHANISM
- Document the equivalence clearly

### 3. What about "grounded abstraction"?

Sutton's term emphasizes:
- Grounded in experience (not arbitrary symbols)
- Actionable (related to behavior)
- Emergent (learned, not designed)

This fits AKIRA perfectly. Should we use "grounded abstraction"?

### 4. How does this relate to "symbol"?

In neurosymbolic:
- Symbol = discrete, manipulable, compositional
- AQ are continuous (magnitude, phase) but discrete in identity
- Bonded states have symbol-like properties (compositional, reusable)

Is a crystallized AQ a "grounded symbol"? Is a bonded state a "composed symbol"?

---

## Evidence This Mapping is Correct

### From the Abstraction Literature

1. **Abstractions are task-relative** (Sutton)
   - AQ are defined by actionability for the task
   - Same signal → different AQ for different tasks
   
2. **Abstractions compress while preserving relevant information**
   - Collapse removes synergy, preserves redundancy
   - What remains is exactly what's needed for action
   
3. **Abstractions form hierarchies**
   - Low-freq bands provide context for high-freq
   - Bonded states can nest
   
4. **Abstractions enable transfer**
   - AQ should transfer across similar tasks
   - Bonded states should generalize to new instances

### From AKIRA's Design

1. **Irreducibility criterion**
   - AQ are minimum patterns for action
   - This IS the definition of atomic abstraction
   
2. **Composition via bonding**
   - Phase alignment combines AQ
   - This IS abstraction composition
   
3. **Collapse as abstraction formation**
   - Synergy → Redundancy removes details
   - What survives is the abstraction

---

## Proposed Resolution

### Option A: Dual Terminology

Keep both terms, document equivalence:

```
MECHANISM TERM          FUNCTION TERM           MEANING
──────────────          ─────────────           ───────
Crystallized AQ         Atomic abstraction      Irreducible primitive
Bonded state            Composed abstraction    Combined primitives
Nested bonded state     Hierarchical abstraction  Multi-level structure
```

Use MECHANISM terms when discussing HOW (spectral, phase, collapse).
Use FUNCTION terms when discussing WHAT (action, generalization, compression).

### Option B: Primary + Alias

Make "abstraction" the primary term, with "bonded state" as implementation detail:

```
PRIMARY                 IMPLEMENTATION          
───────                 ──────────────          
Abstraction             Bonded state (spectral, phase-coherent)
Atomic abstraction      Crystallized AQ
Grounded abstraction    AQ derived from sensorimotor signal
```

### Option C: New Unified Term

Create a term that captures both:
- "Spectral abstraction"?
- "Action abstraction"?
- "Grounded spectral abstraction"?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Discuss**: Which option makes most sense for AKIRA?
2. **Research**: Look deeper into Sutton's abstraction framework
3. **Validate**: Does this mapping hold under scrutiny?
4. **Update**: If we adopt new terminology, update all documents

## Summary of This Working Document

### The Fundamental Insight

```
AQ are MINIMUM UNITS OF ACTION, crystallized from the superposition of belief.
The WHOLE POINT is ACTIONABILITY.
```

This connects directly to Sutton's framework where abstractions are fundamentally related to action.

### The Core Questions and Answers

**Q1: Is "bonded state" = "abstraction"?**

**A1: YES.** AKIRA's bonded states are abstractions in the precise scientific sense.

**Q2: Should we replace "bonded state" with "abstraction"?**

**A2: NO.** Both terms are needed because they describe different aspects:
- "Bonded state" describes STRUCTURE (how AQ combine)
- "Abstraction" describes FUNCTION (why they combine, what they enable)

### The Induction Chain (Validated)

```
Superposition of Belief → [COLLAPSE] → Crystallized AQ (Atomic Abstraction)

```

### What "Bonded" Captures vs What "Abstraction" Adds

| "Bonded State" Captures | "Abstraction" Adds |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Composition (AQ combine) | Established scientific term |
| Bonds (mechanism of combination) | Implies compression/generalization |
| Stability (usable for complex action) | Connects to Sutton, neurosymbolic, cognitive science |
| Phase alignment (how bonds form) | Clearer functional meaning |
| **Structure** | **Function** |

### The Terminology Resolution

Use **dual terminology**:
- **STRUCTURE terms** (crystallized AQ, bonded state) when discussing HOW: spectral decomposition, phase alignment, collapse mechanism
- **FUNCTION terms** (atomic abstraction, composed abstraction) when discussing WHAT/WHY: actionability, generalization, compression

Both vocabularies are valid. Both point to the same underlying reality. The choice depends on which aspect you are emphasizing.

### Evidence This Is Correct

AKIRA's bonded states meet ALL criteria for scientific abstractions:
1. Capture essential features, discard irrelevant details (via collapse)
2. Enable generalization (task-relative, not instance-specific)
3. Compositional (AQ combine into bonded states)
4. Hierarchical (nested bonded states, cross-band structure)
5. Task-relative (actionability defines what matters)
6. Grounded in experience (emerge from signal, not imposed)

### The Connection to Sutton

Sutton's insight: **State abstraction groups states, temporal abstraction groups actions. Both are fundamentally related to action.**

AKIRA's parallel: **AQ are minimum units of action. Bonded states enable higher-level action. The whole point is actionability.**

This is not analogy. This is the same concept expressed in different frameworks.

## Next Steps for Discussion

1. Should we adopt dual terminology formally across all AKIRA documents?
2. When should we use "abstraction" vs "bonded state" in practice?
3. Does "grounded abstraction" (Sutton's term) apply to AKIRA?
4. How do temporal abstractions (action sequences) map to AKIRA's structure?

## Note: Two Levels of Irreducibility

```
REPRESENTATIONAL IRREDUCIBILITY vs COMPUTATIONAL IRREDUCIBILITY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

REPRESENTATIONAL IRREDUCIBILITY (applies to AQ):
  - The REPRESENTATION cannot be simplified further
  - Minimum pattern needed for correct action
  - What crystallization produces
  - Applies to individual AQ and their bonded states

COMPUTATIONAL IRREDUCIBILITY (applies to programs FROM AQ):
  - The EXECUTION cannot be shortcut (Wolfram 2002)
  - Must simulate to know outcome
  - Applies to behaviors/programs constructed from AQ

THE LAYERED VIEW:
  Level 1: AQ (representationally irreducible primitives)
           ↓
  Level 2: Bonded states (composed abstractions)
           ↓
  Level 3: Programs/behaviors (sequences of abstractions)
           ↓
  Level 4: Computational irreducibility (emergent from composition)

IMPLICATION:
  Wolfram's computational irreducibility may emerge at the PROGRAM level
  when representationally irreducible AQ compose into complex behaviors.
  
  The building blocks are representationally irreducible.
  What you build from them may be computationally irreducible.
