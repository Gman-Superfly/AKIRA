# Heisenberg's 1925 Paper: A Step-by-Step Exposition

In the summer of 1925, Werner Heisenberg developed the first consistent theory of quantum mechanics. The paper he wrote is cryptic even for experts. However, it contains four groundbreaking ideas that fundamentally changed the rules of physics.

This document presents these ideas, concepts, and calculations to demonstrate exactly how Heisenberg created quantum mechanics.

Heisenberg's paper, titled "On the Quantum-Theoretical Reinterpretation of Kinematical and Mechanical Relationships," is difficult to follow. Some sections lack continuity and some mathematical steps appear without clear justification.

The goal here is to make Heisenberg's paper more accessible.

By the end, the reader will discover how the famous zero-point energy appears in Heisenberg's theory and encounter an early draft of what later became the uncertainty principle.

This exposition is divided into three parts:

1. The experimental fact that led to matrices
2. The four core ideas and calculations in the paper
3. One of the examples that Heisenberg provided at the end of his paper, including all mathematical details

## Part 1: Why Matrices?

Heisenberg's theory of quantum mechanics became known as matrix mechanics because of the use of these mathematical arrays of numbers.

The fundamental question is: Why are matrices needed in quantum mechanics?

The answer lies in a simple experimental observation made by the Swiss physicist Walter Ritz in the summer of 1908.

Consider some of the lines of the hydrogen spectrum. Taking pairs of lines and adding their inverse wavelengths reveals a clear pattern. This pattern is explained by a formula that Rydberg found in 1888 for the wavelength of hydrogen spectral lines in terms of two integer numbers j and k, where R is just a constant.

Multiplying by the speed of light yields frequencies instead. Notice what happens when two frequencies are added in which the second index of one is identical to the first index of the other. Using the formula, the middle indices cancel out, producing a new frequency with the first index of one and the second index of the other.

This relation is a general result for spectral lines. The relation is an example of the **Ritz combination principle**, which describes how the frequencies of spectral lines combine to form new frequencies.


this experimental fact is the reason for the need of matrices.
Since 1900, quantum physics was a collection of arbitrary and unjustified
rules that became known as old quantum theory. Heisenberg changed all that
after an isolation retreat in a remote island in June 1925.
After his return, he wrote a cryptic paper titled on the quantum theoretical
reinterpretation of kinematical and mechanical relationships in which he laid out four rules for calculating the
outcome of experiments. Everything began with Einstein's quantum theory of radiation from 1917. After
completing his monumental work on general relativity, Einstein returned to the study of radiation, introducing two
key innovations, a new process called stimulated emission and transition
probabilities for describing the absorption and emission of light. Unfortunately, there was no way to
determine these probabilities. The breakthrough came in early 1921 when
Rudolfph Latenburgg found a way to connect Einstein's quantum probabilities
with classical quantities that could be measured in dispersion experiments. Inspired by Latenburg, this idea was
extended by Henrik Kramers who found a quantum theory of dispersion. Kramers
and Max Bourne also discovered a mathematical relation between classical
and quantum relations that was crucial for Heisenberg. Let's now look at
Heisenberg's famous paper. The key word is reinterpretation.
Historians of science refer to this work as the unon paper. What everyone was
searching for during the 1920s was a way to derive quantum equations to replace
the equations of classical mechanics. Heisenberg built on the ideas of Einstein, Latenburg, Kmers, Bore and
Bourne to find the quantum equivalent of physical quantities from a classical
theory. He starts by setting one of the core ideas in which his quantum
mechanics is built. It is advisable to completely discard unobserved quantities
such as the electrons position and period. Instead, it seems more
reasonable to try to establish a theory of quantum mechanics in which only relationships among observable
quantities occur. This is one of the most radical ideas in the history of physics, one that leads to debates even
today. Heisenberg proposes here that quantum mechanics is only a theory about
experimental observables. In his paper, these are the transition amplitudes and
frequencies. Although this idea is usually attributed to Heisenberg, one of
its main proponents was Wol and Powley. His letters show that by the summer of
1925, he had convinced most of the key figures of quantum theory about this
idea. This is something that Einstein and Shinger strongly opposed. For them,
physics is about describing nature as a whole, including all its underlying
mechanisms, even those that we cannot measure. We could say that with this
sentence, Heisenberg began the infamous shut up and calculate approach. After this, Heisenberg begins his rumblings. I stop
following the paper here and present the ideas in a more coherent order pointing out to the corresponding results in the
paper. The first concept is position. The classical view of the electron
orbiting the nucleus was enough for atoms with a single electron but failed
with all the others. After his work with Bourne, Heisenberg knew that a classical
periodic motion of an electron in a stationary state n can be described as
an infinite sum of oscillations. This is called a furier series. A more general
way to write this is by using a complex exponential instead where the sum is
over all positive and negative values of the index alpha. I will later drop the
estimation range to simplify notation. The factors a alpha are called fura
modes and kramers showed in his doctoral thesis that these factors are directly
related to the transition probabilities between states introduced by Einstein in
his paper on quantum radiation. The position is a real quantity. Forcing all
this sum to be equal to its own complex conjugate implies a relation between the
negative and positive fura modes. This relation will be very useful later. Here
heisenberg introduces his first seminal idea. According to the correspondence
principle, the classical frequency of the orbital motion of the electron and
its harmonics get replaced by the transition frequencies between atomic
states. Alpha omega becomes omega and k where n is the current state of the
electron and k is any other state that the electron can transition via a
quantum jump. Just for clarity in this text, I will use the subindex k as
short notation for n minus alpha. Now we can write the position of the quantum
electron in this way where the classical furier modes are replaced by transition
amplitudes with two indices to match the transition frequencies that obey the
ritz combination principle. Just like in the classical case, forcing the position
to be a real quantity implies this relationship. Reversing the indices of
the amplitudes is equivalent to checking its complex conjugate. This relation
corresponds to Heisenber's position reinterpretation and the word kinematics
in the title of his paper. Note that the positive values of alpha represent
quantum transitions between the current state n and lower levels whereas the
negative values denote higher levels. With this expression, Heisenberg built a
tower of so-called virtual oscillators. The next concept is motion. I bet many
of you were not expecting to find Newton's second law in the foundational paper on quantum mechanics, but this is
Heisenberg's starting point. Writing the force and acceleration as functions of
position, dividing by the mass of the particle and collecting terms on the
left hand side. Heisenberg renamed this ratio just f. His idea is that depending
on the physical system of interest, all you have to do is to identify the potential energy, calculate f and
properly write this equation of motion in terms of the quantum position as defined in the previous section. This
concept is the mechanics in the title of his paper. as examples for the harmonic
oscillator f is just omega^ squar * x
whereas the so-called unharmonic oscillator has an extra term with x
squared in general for any function we can expand the function as a power
series of x and here realized that we need a proper definition of how to
calculate powers of x which takes us to the third concept Multiplication.
This concept is probably the most important and revolutionary in the paper. Back to the classical
definitions. Let's see what the product of two positions X and Y is in terms of
FIA modes. For this, we simply multiply two FA series where A are the modes of X
and B are the modes of Y. Note that the exponential now combines harmonics of X
and Y. However, we can introduce a new index toao which allows writing the
product as a new fier series. Defining the new fier modes in terms of a and b,
we explicitly find that the product of two positions x and y gives a series
that has the same structure as x. This is one of the great properties of a
series. We can calculate the product between y and x instead. Following the
same steps as before, we find that the order of the product makes no difference. We call quantities that
satisfy this relation commutative objects. A common example is real
numbers. The order of the factors does not affect the product. Now we repeat
this but using the quantum reinterpretation of position and frequency introduced before. Taking
their product, we must be careful with the indices. And just like in the classical case, the two corresponding
frequencies appear added in the exponential. But now we have a problem. Note that the two frequencies cannot be
combined into a new frequency like in the classical case because the indices do not match the RIT's combination
principle. This would mark the end of Heisenber's efforts because the product
of two series does not produce a new series. But here comes the bold move.
Heisenberg proposed that this is not how quantum objects are multiplied. He wants
the two frequencies in the exponential to have the indices in such order that the Ritz combination principle can be
used to convert this sum of quantum frequencies into a single new frequency.
Remember that the ritz combination principle is an experimental fact. Heisenber simply took this feature of
nature and used it to invent a new way to manipulate transition frequencies.
His multiplication rule is that the second index of the first amplitude must
be equal to the first index of the second amplitude. In this way, the two
frequencies in the exponential can be easily added using the Ritz combination principle. Now we proceed just as
before. We rename the product of amplitudes and find that the product of these two quantum objects is a series
like the original. We can repeat the same steps to calculate y * x instead.
But now we find that the indices are arranged in a way that the two products are except in very special cases not
equal. Here Heisenberg found that a consequence of his quantum reinterpretation is that quantum objects
are not commutative. This is the bold conceptual innovation that makes this
paper the foundation of modern quantum mechanics. This weird multiplication
rule made Heisenberg very uncomfortable. In the paper he wrote this
multiplication rule is an almost necessary consequence of the frequency combination rules. He accepted what his
theory was telling him but could not make sense of the meaning of these non-commutative objects. After his
return from Helgoland, he expressed his concern to Max Bourne. What are these
objects that obey these rules? Let me bring back the way the transition amplitudes are combined. Heisenberg was
baffled by this relation. But today, even a freshman student would recognize
it as matrix multiplication. Believe it or not, Heisenberg didn't know about
matrices. This is how Hans Bete, one of the great students of Somerfield and
Heisenberg, described it. So he said we should only talk about
experimentally observable quantities both the frequencies and these
amplitudes but should forget about the motion of electrons in orbits.
Then he discussed just how these quantities Q
and PKN should occur in the theory. how would you form kinetic and potential
energy from them? And he found that these uh quantities obeyed very strange
multiplication rules which he had never seen before. But he wrote down these
multiplication rules. Uh P and Q just did not uh behave like ordinary
algebraic quantities. when he came home to Guttingan
uh Max Bon told him but Heisenberg what you have there is simply the multiplication of matrices.
Now you all learn about matrices probably in your freshman year or at
most in your sophomore year but Heisenberg had never heard about matrices.
Thanks to Bourne, Heisenberg discovered that quantum objects follow the rules of
matrix algebra. But this only happened after he wrote his paper. Before we
judge Heisenberg for not knowing about matrices, the same was true for most physicists of the time. Matrix algebra
was so unknown that the paper that Bourne and Jordan wrote following on Heisenber's work began with a full
section explaining the basics of matrices. The fourth and final concept introduced
by Heisenberg was a new quantization rule. I remind you that old quantum
theory was mostly based on the rule developed by Bore and Somerfeld. This
was very successful for describing an isolated hydrogen atom, but it failed in
light of new experiments. This rule worked as follows. First, write the
classical equation of motion. then solve the equation to find the classical solution and finally force the classical
solution to satisfy the bore summerfeld rule. In Heisenber's approach, the
classical solution is irrelevant because the goal is to determine the transition amplitudes and frequencies. For this
reason, a new quantization rule was needed. Heisenberg took the rule from old quantum theory and replaced momentum
and position by their classical FA expansions. Using the chain rule, the
integral over position can be turned into an integral over one orbital
period. We need to determine x dot squared. Since we know x, we can
directly take the time derivative and then take the product with itself. These
are classical free expansions. So this is the conventional product. Now we can
use a trick. Since the sum over beta includes all positive and negative
values, we can replace beta by minus beta in this expression and the sum does
not change. In this line, I have simply replaced every beta by minus beta. Now
we can integrate over time. The orbital period is related to the frequency. So
we can make this change of variables. This angular integral is not trivial but
it happens to vanish except when beta is equal to alpha. In case you are familiar
with the name this is an integral representation of the chronicer delta.
This means that when summing over beta all terms are zero except when beta
equals alpha and this expression reduces to a single sum. There is nothing new
here. This relation is just the bore summerfell rule for fier modes. Now
Heisenberg tried to reinterpret this relation. The obvious thing to do is
replacing the fier modes and harmonics frequencies by transition amplitudes and
quantum frequencies respectively. However, there is a problem. What to do with this extra index alpha?
Heisenberg's reinterpretation of frequency only eliminates one of the alpha indices. meaning that a direct
reinterpretation of the bore summerfeld rule is not possible. Here is
Heisenberg's workaround. He took the derivative with respect to the quantum
number n on both sides. This expression looks even more complicated. But here he
invoked what we could call the reinterpretation discovered independently by Bourne and Kmers. This
relation turns classical derivatives into quantum differences.
This is one of the great outcomes obtained in the spirit of the failed BKS theory. Using this relation, Heisenberg was able to transform the quantum rule
of the old quantum theory into his new language of transition amplitudes and
frequencies. Heisenber understood that this rule provides a recursive relation
between amplitudes. Once you know the amplitude for one quantum transition,
this relation allows finding the others. This formula and the equation of motion
with the corresponding multiplication rule constitute the equations of Heisenberg's quantum theory. And these
are the revolutionary ideas in the paper. Here is a summary of the key concepts in Heisenberg's paper. Position
is written in terms of transition amplitudes and frequencies. These two quantities are the central unknowns of
the theory because they are observable in experiments. The transition amplitudes define the intensity of the
spectral lines and the frequencies determine their wavelength. Motion is characterized by the quantum
position object satisfying the classical equations. Note that Heisenberg's theory
is Newtonian. This was later improved and turned into a more general
Hamiltonian theory by Heisenberg in collaboration with Bourne and Jordan.
Quantum objects obey an unusual
multiplication rule. Non-commutativity of quantum quantities is one of the
central discoveries in the paper. Thanks to Bourne, Heisenberg and the rest of the physics community learned that
transition amplitudes are described by matrix algebra and Heisenberg's theory
became known as the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. The quantum nature of transition
amplitudes and frequencies is specified by Heisenberg's reinterpretation of the
old Bore Somerfell quantum rule. Here is where plank's constant enters the
equations. And that's it. This is the recipe for a self-consistent and
systematic quantum mechanics. Heisenberg described it like this. Equations 11 and
16 contain a complete determination not only of frequencies and energy values
but also of quantum transition probabilities. The paper also includes two crucial
questions probably influenced by the recent reputation of BKS theory.
Heisenberg wondered about energy conservation and also whether the energy levels predicted by his theory would
satisfy the wellestablished bore Einstein relation. But the only way to
answer these questions was by testing the theory with examples. This is what I
will do in the next part. Heisenberg's method was a first draft
for quantum mechanics. All the main ingredients are there, but he knew that a mathematical refinement was needed. He
ended his paper with an invitation to such mathematical polishing of his ideas. Whether the method proposed here
can be regarded as satisfactory can be decided only by more intensive mathematical investigation. The method
has been very superficially employed here. In the last section of this text, an explicit example shows how to use Heisenberg's idea for a
particular system. Although I will present a simplified case, I will include all the gory details because I
find this a very instructive exercise. The main ideas in Heisenberg's paper become much clearer
after going through these calculations. This would let you appreciate the amount
of work behind every result in the paper and hopefully give you a glimpse of the work of a theoretical physicist.
Heisenber begins section three of his paper with as a simple example the
anharmonic oscillator will now be treated. The interest in the unharmonic
oscillator is that just like the hydrogen atom transitions between all levels are possible. However, this
example requires familiarity with the methods of perturbation theory. Since I
want this exercise to be valuable even if this is your first encounter with quantum mechanics, I will only cover the
particular case of lambda equals 0. This is the simple harmonic oscillator. There
is a running joke that the simple harmonic oscillator is the only system that physicists know how to solve.
Sydney Coleman described it better. The career of a young theoretical physicist
consists of treating the harmonic oscillator in ever-increasing levels of abstraction. And if you have studied
quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, you know that this is true. First we solve this using the Bohr-Sommerfeld rule of the old quantum theory and then using Heisenberg's quantum mechanics so we can compare. As you probably know, the differential
equation of the harmonic oscillator is exactly satisfied by this general
solution where a and b are constants and omega kn is the fundamental frequency of
the oscillator. Comparing this solution with the general fier series, we
immediately find that there are only two nonzero fier modes and the harmonics are
given by multiples of omega kn. This means that the infinite sum only has two
terms. Following the recipe of old quantum theory, now that we have found a
classical solution, we make it quantum by forcing it to obey the bore summerfield rule for fier modes found
before where n is an integer. Let's not forget that this sum has only two terms.
One for alpha= 1 and alpha= minus1. by properties of complex numbers. This
reduces to a single term from which we directly find the general expression of
the only nonzero fier mode. Let's now calculate the energy levels of this old
quantum oscillator. Note that we need to determine x dot squared and x². And for
this we use our simple fa expansion. X dot is given by this. And it's a square
leads to three terms. Then we do the same for x^2. The calculation is very
similar. Plug in these two quantities in the expression for energy, we have six
terms, but two pairs cancel each other out while the other two are identical.
Note that all time dependence disappears, meaning that the energy levels are constant in time. Energy is
conserved. We have found the energy levels in terms of the fier modes. We
can now replace our previous result to find that the energy levels are proportional to the quantum number n.
For this reason, the energy gap between two adjacent levels is exactly h bar
omega kn and the bore einstein relation is satisfied. Here is the summary of the
results. Now we repeat this but following method.
Just like before, we begin with the quantum position, but instead of using the classical solution, we calculate the
second time derivative to replace it into the equation of motion. Factorizing
common terms, we find this relation. From now on, we will need the complete form of the indices. So, I am replacing
K by N minus alpha. Under the assumption that every state has its own energy for
each value of alpha in the sum, the exponent will be different. This means
that each element of the sum must individually vanish. For alpha equals 0,
we get this. Since the transition frequency of a state with itself is
zero, we find that the same is true for the amplitude. For alpha equals 1, we
get this. Inspired by the classical result, we set the amplitude between one level and the next to be non zero, which
gives us a constant value for the transition frequency. Contrary to the
hydrogen atom, here the frequencies are independent of the quantum number n,
which means that the energy levels are equally spaced. We can now repeat for
alpha= minus1 to get this. Just like the classical case, the only nonzero
transition amplitudes are between adjacent states. Using that the energy levels are equally spaced implies that
for all other values of alpha, the amplitude is zero. Summarizing from the
equation of motion, we found the frequencies and the nonvanishing amplitudes. This condition that the only
allowed transitions are between states that defer by one quantum unit is
usually known as selection rules. We still need to find the value of these two amplitudes. For this, we use the
older equation in Heisenberg's method, the quantum condition. As mentioned
before, this equation provides a recursive way to determine the amplitudes. Since alpha can only take
two values, we can expand the sum leading to four terms. Using the previous result for the transition
amplitudes and being extra careful with the order of the indices to get all the signs right, we find that the four terms
reduce to two terms. Finally, we can write the recursive relation for the
amplitudes. The next step is defining a so-called ground state. This is defined
as the lowest possible state of the system. Setting this to be represented
by n equals 0, we get the following. In this step, heisenber reasoned that
transitions below the level n= 0 do not exist by definition of ground state.
Therefore, this term must be zero. And with this, we find our first transition
amplitude. Next we take n= 1 which is given in terms of the transition that we
just found. We can repeat for n= 2 and quickly find the pattern for any state
n. This is the transition amplitude which I will add to the summary on the
top right. Note that the absolute value allows reversing the state indices
without affecting the result. Also notice that we can replace n by n minus
one to obtain this pair of relations that will be useful in a minute. The
final calculation is the energy of the oscillator. Just like before we need to determine x dot squar and x^2. But this
time we must use Heisenber's multiplication rule. For x dot we simply
take the derivative with respect to time. Here notice that all these terms
correspond to the amplitude that we have to use in the multiplication rule. The
product of x dot with itself gives us this long expression. Now we use that
only transitions between adjacent states are allowed to expand the sum over
alpha. So we get two terms for the sum over beta. We have to be extra careful.
Let's look at this term from the selection rules. The indices in the amplitude can only defer by one.
Therefore, beta can only take the values zero or two leading to these two terms.
Using the same method with the second term, we find that beta can only take
the values 0 and minus2 producing the next two terms. Now we have to evaluate
the frequencies. Since the two amplitudes have the same indices in
reverse order, their product is just the squared magnitude. Using our previous
results, the first frequency is positive and equal to omega KN. Whereas the
second frequency has the same indices in reverse order. So it has an extra minus.
Finally, we use that the transition frequency of a state with itself is zero. Just to make sure that the method
is clear, let me do the second term. Here the product of amplitudes remains
as it is. The first frequency is again omega kn whereas the second frequency is
also omega kn. If this is unclear, just replace n by n minus one in the formula
above. The exponent is no longer zero. Since we know that the energy levels are
equally spaced, the frequency between levels two units apart is simply two
times omega KN. Using the same procedure with the other two terms, we get this.
Taking out the common factor omega squared, we have found the expression
needed for the kinetic energy. The same steps are needed for x^2. We expand the
sum over alpha, then sum over beta and evaluate the frequencies. This is much
easier than the previous one. And now we're ready to calculate the energy of the oscillator. Like the semi-class
case, all the time dependent terms cancel each other out, making the energy
levels constant. This answers Heisenberg's question about energy conservation. Yes, the energy of the
harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics is conserved. Now I bring back the
amplitudes that we found before because we can determine the final expression for the energy. Plugging the two
relevant amplitudes, we get this. Factorizing common terms, we finally
find the energy. Here is the summary of all the results that we found. We can
answer Heisenberg's second question. Yes, given that the energy levels are equally spaced, the bore Einstein
relation is satisfied. This is the final answer from Heisenberg's point of view.
It is not the position of the oscillator or its speed but the observable
quantities transition amplitudes and frequencies. Additionally, we find that the energy of
the ground state is not zero, but 1/2 h bar omega kn exactly as many experiments
indicated. There was no room for this factor 1/2 h bar omega in quantum
theory before Heisenberg. Bringing back the results of the semic-class theory of
the harmonic oscillator, we see that Heisenber's theory agrees with all the results of the bore summer theory except
for the 0 point energy. In the old theory, the energy of the ground state n
equals 0 is exactly zero. in contradiction with many experiments at
low temperatures that show that quantum systems exhibit a remnant energy of 1/2
h bar omega. The hope was that a systematic theory of quantum mechanics
could explain the origin of this residual energy and Heisenberg's quantum mechanics did exactly that. If you track
the origin of the constant term in the energy, you will find it to arise from
the new quantum condition. Bourne and Jordan transformed this new rule created
by Heisenberg into one of the fundamental building blocks of quantum mechanics found today in textbooks. The
so-called canonical quantum commutation relation from which the famous Heisenberg's uncertainty principle can
be derived. But this happens two years later. For now, I wanted to show you that Heisenberg's paper already contains
many of the blueprints for modern quantum mechanics. And although he didn't know it, this formula is the
first draft of his famous uncertainty principle. This is a remarkable paper and hopefully with
this exposition any student even at the undergraduate level can understand its
significance and reproduce the original calculations. Most textbooks present
these results as coming out of a magic hat but in reality they can be derived
using some math a good understanding of the historical context and more
importantly building out of experimental evidence.
